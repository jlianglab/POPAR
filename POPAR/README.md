# POPAR: Patch Order Prediction and Appearance Recovery for self-supervised learning in chest radiography

This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of the POPAR: Patch Order Prediction and Appearance Recovery for self-supervised learning in chest radiography.

We propose POPAR (patch order prediction and appearance recovery), a novel vision transformer-based self-supervised learning framework for chest X-ray images. POPAR leverages the benefits of vision transformers and unique properties of medical imaging, aiming to simultaneously learn patch-wise high-level contextual features by correcting shuffled patch orders and fine-grained features by recovering patch appearance.
